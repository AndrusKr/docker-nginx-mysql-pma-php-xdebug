# docker-nginx-mysql-pma-php-xdebug
This is a working template for a handy development in the latest version of Php with Composer inside and
using XDebug on PhpStorm or VSCode (as you wish:) + the latest versions of nginx, MySQL8.0 &amp; PhpMyAdmin. 

To start using it just complete the following steps:
1. git clone 
2. adjust the .env file according to your needs
3. place the PHP code you'd like to run in this template
4. docker-compose up --build -d

Done! ;)
